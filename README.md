# ColorMyViews

`ColorMyViews` is a companion Android app for the **Udacity** course [Developing Android Apps with Kotlin](https://eu.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012).

This really simple Android app, implemented as an Android Studio project,
showcases how to build a very basic Android app in Kotlin. The app's purpose is to show how to use ConstraintLayout to build a flat UI widget hierarchy and also how to dynamically move/reposition UI widgets at runtime.

I am just learning Android app development (and also `git` and `GitHub`) and
these sample repos are just a means of practicing - so please don't expect mind blowing
highlights here.  :smile:

This app just implements and demonstrates the bare-to-the-bones feature(s) as advertised,
not much else.

## Installation

Android Studio project. Clone or download as ZIP and import into Android Studio.

Targets Android API level 28 (`Pie`), so depending on your installation,
you may be prompted to download that SDK version during build.

## Usage

Just `Click` on the different UI elements and see what's happening. :wink:

## Contributing

See: repo description - just a learning/demo app, nothing breathtakingly elaborate!
But, if you really want to:
  1. Fork it!
  2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
  3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
  4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
  5. Submit a pull request :D
